In this project, I worked with zip files, images and the files system. I had to develop an MVP for a image viewing app. The app should display a list of collages of images and when tapped, display all the images for a particular collection.

## Objectives

- [x] First hit the API do get the collections (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mob3/image_collection.json)
- [x] The json response has an array of collection with a url to a zip file for each collection.
- [x] Download the zip files and unzip them to a temporary store.
- [x] Display the preview images (_preview.png) and the name of the collection in a list
- [x] When a user taps a collection, display the images for that collection.
